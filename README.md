### Hi there 👋🏾


**Who is this character?** <br>
I'm O-drey, an introvert french woman who deals with others madness and her own thanks to sarcasm (if your carburant is coffee, don't juge me).
My pronouns are _she/her_.
To give you an idea of my personality, I am the archetype of an Aquarius meme and I swing between Architect (INTJ) and Commander (ENTJ) types.
I am currently a learner (yep, we don't use the word _student_ to describe us) at Ada Tech School, a french feminist software development school based in Paris and Nantes.


**What are her interests?** <br>
  ❤️ Broadly speaking, I'm interested in ecodesign and accessibility in the graphical design and web development fields. <br>
  🔭 On the development side, I have a deep keen on APIs and websites. And on the design side, I've fallen for Graphic and UX Design. <br>
  🌱 For now, I'm learning Javascript, PHP and Spanish. Next step: C or C++ ! <br>
  📌 I'm fond of bubble teas, tattoos, plushes and Webtoons (_1HP Club_, _Purple Hyacinth_, _Boyfriends_, _Lore Olympus_, ...). <br>
  🤯 Fun facts : I've killed two out of three succulents in only one month (the last one is a survivor 🌵), and I succeed to burn everything I cook: so it's barbecue all year long! 😂
