### Hi there 👋🏾


**Who is this character?** <br>
I'm O-drey, a designer and front-end developer.
My pronouns are _she/her_.

**What are my interests?** <br>
  ❤️ Broadly speaking, I'm interested in ecodesign and accessibility in the graphical design and web development fields. <br>
  🔭 On the development side, I have a deep keen on datavisualization and front-end development. And on the design side, I've fallen for Graphic and UX Design. <br>
  🌱 For now, I'm learning TypeScript and broadening my knowledge on VueJS. Next step: ~~Golang~~ Astro and Vanilla JS ! <br>
  📌 I'm fond of bubble teas, tattoos, plushes and Webtoons (_1HP Club_, _Purple Hyacinth_, _Boyfriends_, _Lore Olympus_, ...). <br>
  🤯 Fun facts : I've killed two out of three succulents in only one month (the last one ~~is a survivor 🌵~~ died a year later), and I succeed to burn everything I cook: so it's barbecue all year long! 😂
